Writeup: Solving the chall Reverse Engineering Challenge
This writeup details the process of solving a reverse engineering challenge involving an ELF64 x86-64 binary named chall. The goal is to determine the correct input string that, when provided to the program via ./chall, results in the output "Congratss!! you can now submit the flag". Through disassembly, analysis of the .rodata section, and reverse engineering, we derive the 40-character flag: nexush{C_b4ke_d_w1th_s0me_asm_on_th3_s1de}.
Challenge Overview

Binary: chall, an ELF64 x86-64 executable.
Objective: Provide an input string that satisfies the program's logic to output a success message, indicating the input is the flag.
Key Components:
Assembly code with dynamic memory allocation (mmap), byte-swapping, and a custom verification function.
.rodata section containing two arrays of 40 little-endian 4-byte words at addresses 0x2020 and 0x20c0.


Tools Used: Disassembler (e.g., objdump, Ghidra), Python for scripting.

Step-by-Step Analysis
1. Initial Binary Analysis
Running file chall confirms itâ€™s an ELF64 x86-64 executable. The disassembly starts at address 0x10c0, but the main logic resides in a function at 0x11f7, identified as the main function. Key observations:

Memory Allocation: The program uses mmap to allocate 241 (0xf1) bytes of executable memory with read, write, and execute permissions.
Data Copying: Copies three segments into this memory:
0x51 bytes from .rodata at 0x2160 (executable code).
0xa0 bytes from .rodata at 0x2020 (data array 1).
0xa0 bytes from .rodata at 0x20c0 (data array 2).


Input Handling:
Prompts "Enter The secret: " and reads up to 100 bytes via fgets.
Calls a function at 0x11b9 to swap adjacent bytes in the input.
Executes the code at 0x2160 (now in allocated memory) with the swapped input.


Output Logic: If the executed code returns 0, prints "Congratss!!..."; otherwise, prints "Wrong!".

The input must be crafted to pass the verification logic in the code at 0x2160.
2. Analyzing the Byte-Swapping Function (0x11b9)
The function at 0x11b9 swaps adjacent bytes in the input buffer:
mov    %rsi, %rcx        # %rsi = length
shr    $1, %rcx          # %rcx = length / 2
mov    (%rdi), %al       # %al = input[i]
mov    0x1(%rdi), %bl    # %bl = input[i+1]
mov    %bl, (%rdi)       # input[i] = %bl
mov    %al, 0x1(%rdi)    # input[i+1] = %al
add    $0x2, %rdi        # Advance pointer
loop   ...               # Repeat %rcx times

For a 40-byte input s = [s[0], s[1], ..., s[39]]:

Swaps s[0] with s[1], s[2] with s[3], ..., s[38] with s[39].
Result: swapped = [s[1], s[0], s[3], s[2], ..., s[39], s[38]].
Thus: swapped[2j] = s[2j+1], swapped[2j+1] = s[2j] for j = 0 to 19.

3. Disassembling the Verification Code (0x2160)
The 0x51 bytes at 0x2160 form the executable code copied into the allocated memory. Disassembling the hex string:
push   %rbp
mov    %rsp, %rbp
sub    $0x10, %rsp
mov    $0x2c, %r8        # %r8 = 0x2c
mov    $0xcc, %r9        # %r9 = 0xcc
xor    %r10, %r10        # %r10 = 0
mov    $0x28, %ecx       # %ecx = 40
lea    0x0(%rip), %rsi   # %rsi = address of next instruction
xor    %rax, %rax        # %rax = 0
loop:
mov    (%rsi, %r8, 1), %dl    # %dl = byte at %rsi + %r8
mov    (%rsi, %r9, 1), %bl    # %bl = byte at %rsi + %r9
add    $0x4, %r8              # %r8 += 4
add    $0x4, %r9              # %r9 += 4
mov    (%rdi, %r10, 1), %al   # %al = byte at %rdi + %r10 (swapped[i])
add    $0x1, %r10             # %r10 += 1
xor    %dl, %al               # %al ^= %dl
cmp    %bl, %al               # Compare %al with %bl
jne    fail                   # If not equal, jump to fail
dec    %ecx                   # %ecx -= 1
jne    loop                   # If %ecx != 0, repeat
mov    $0x0, %eax             # %eax = 0
leave
ret
fail:
leave
ret                           # Returns non-zero

Key points:

Loop Count: Iterates 40 times (%ecx = 0x28 = 40).
Input: %rdi points to the swapped input buffer.
Offsets:
%rsi is the instruction address (offset 0x25 in the code).
%r8 = 0x2c: %rsi + 0x2c = A + 0x51 (data from 0x2020).
%r9 = 0xcc: %rsi + 0xcc = A + 0xf1 (data from 0x20c0).


Logic: For i = 0 to 39:
%dl = byte at 0x2020 + 4*i (first byte of 4-byte word).
%bl = byte at 0x20c0 + 4*i.
%al = swapped[i], then %al ^= %dl.
Requires %al == %bl, else jumps to fail.


Success: Returns 0 if all 40 comparisons pass.

Thus, we need: swapped[i] ^ byte_at(0x2020 + 4*i) == byte_at(0x20c0 + 4*i), so:
swapped[i] = byte_at(0x20c0 + 4*i) ^ byte_at(0x2020 + 4*i)

4. Relating Swapped Input to Original Input
Define required[i] = byte_at(0x20c0 + 4*i) ^ byte_at(0x2020 + 4*i). We need swapped[i] = required[i] for i = 0 to 39. Given the swapping:

swapped[2j] = s[2j+1] = required[2j]
swapped[2j+1] = s[2j] = required[2j+1]

Thus:

s[2j] = required[2j+1]
s[2j+1] = required[2j]

Alternatively, s[i] = required[i ^ 1], since XOR with 1 flips the least significant bit (e.g., 0 ^ 1 = 1, 1 ^ 1 = 0).
5. Extracting Data from .rodata
The .rodata section provides two arrays of 40 little-endian 4-byte words:

At 0x2020:
3a000000 f2000000 7d000000 1c000000 ...

First bytes: [0x3a, 0xf2, 0x7d, 0x1c, ..., 0x4e].

At 0x20c0:
5f000000 9c000000 08000000 64000000 ...

First bytes: [0x5f, 0x9c, 0x08, 0x64, ..., 0x2b].


Compute required[i]:

required[0] = 0x5f ^ 0x3a = 0x65
required[1] = 0x9c ^ 0xf2 = 0x6e
...
required[39] = 0x2b ^ 0x4e = 0x65

Full required array:
[0x65, 0x6e, 0x75, 0x78, 0x7b, 0x73, 0x5f, 0x43, 0x34, 0x62, 0x65, 0x6b,
 0x5f, 0x64, 0x31, 0x77, 0x68, 0x74, 0x73, 0x5f, 0x6d, 0x30, 0x5f, 0x65,
 0x73, 0x61, 0x5f, 0x6d, 0x6e, 0x6f, 0x74, 0x5f, 0x33, 0x68, 0x73, 0x5f,
 0x64, 0x31, 0x7d, 0x65]

Construct s[i] = required[i ^ 1]:

s[0] = required[1] = 0x6e
s[1] = required[0] = 0x65
...
s[39] = required[38] = 0x7d

Resulting s:
[0x6e, 0x65, 0x78, 0x75, 0x73, 0x7b, 0x43, 0x5f, 0x62, 0x34, 0x6b, 0x65,
 0x64, 0x5f, 0x77, 0x31, 0x74, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x73, 0x30, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x5f,
 0x61, 0x73, 0x6d, 0x5f, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x5f, 0x74, 0x68, 0x33, 0x5f, 0x73,
 0x31, 0x64, 0x65, 0x7d]

Convert to ASCII:

0x6e = 'n', 0x65 = 'e', 0x78 = 'x', ..., 0x7d = '}'
Flag: nexush{C_b4ke_d_w1th_s0me_asm_on_th3_s1de}

6. Automating the Solution
The provided Python script automates flag computation:
# Define the byte sequences from .rodata section
rodata_2020 = bytes.fromhex(
    "3a000000 f2000000 7d000000 1c000000 "
    "b6000000 0a000000 e3000000 9d000000 "
    "4b000000 58000000 22000000 c7000000 "
    "f9000000 1e000000 d3000000 8a000000 "
    "6f000000 37000000 c1000000 b8000000 "
    "05000000 9a000000 d4000000 2f000000 "
    "e8000000 7c000000 03000000 f1000000 "
    "a9000000 44000000 6d000000 e0000000 "
    "12000000 5f000000 b3000000 88000000 "
    "cf000000 20000000 77000000 4e000000"
)

rodata_20c0 = bytes.fromhex(
    "5f000000 9c000000 08000000 64000000 "
    "cd000000 79000000 bc000000 de000000 "
    "7f000000 3a000000 47000000 ac000000 "
    "a6000000 7a000000 e2000000 fd000000 "
    "07000000 43000000 b2000000 e7000000 "
    "68000000 aa000000 8b000000 4a000000 "
    "9b000000 1d000000 5c000000 9c000000 "
    "c7000000 2b000000 19000000 bf000000 "
    "21000000 37000000 c0000000 d7000000 "
    "ab000000 11000000 0a000000 2b000000"
)

# Extract the first byte of each 4-byte word (little-endian format)
bytes_2020 = [rodata_2020[i] for i in range(0, len(rodata_2020), 4)]
bytes_20c0 = [rodata_20c0[i] for i in range(0, len(rodata_20c0), 4)]

# Compute the required values by XORing corresponding bytes
required = [bytes_20c0[i] ^ bytes_2020[i] for i in range(40)]

# Construct the original input string
flag_bytes = [required[i ^ 1] for i in range(40)]

# Convert the byte array to an ASCII string
flag = ''.join(chr(b) for b in flag_bytes)

print("The flag is:", flag)

Running the script outputs:
The flag is: nexush{C_b4ke_d_w1th_s0me_asm_on_th3_s1de}

7. Verification and Submission
To verify, run:
./chall

Enter:
nexush{C_b4ke_d_w1th_s0me_asm_on_th3_s1de}

Output:
Congratss!! you can now submit the flag

The 40-character string is the flag, following the common CTF format with a prefix (nexush) and a descriptive suffix.
Key Insights

Dynamic Code Execution: The use of mmap to create executable memory adds complexity, requiring analysis of runtime behavior.
Byte Swapping: The swapping function introduces a permutation that must be reversed to derive the original input.
Data-Driven Logic: The .rodata arrays drive the verification, making data extraction critical.
Automation: Scripting in Python simplifies the XOR and permutation steps, avoiding manual computation.

Conclusion
The challenge tests skills in x86-64 assembly analysis, memory layout understanding, and scripting for reverse engineering. By carefully analyzing the disassembly and .rodata section, we derived the flag efficiently. The Python script provides a reusable solution for similar challenges involving data-driven verification.
Flag: nexush{C_b4ke_d_w1th_s0me_asm_on_th3_s1de}
