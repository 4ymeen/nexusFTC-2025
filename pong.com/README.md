Writeup: Patching pong.com with Python Script
Overview
The provided Python script, patch_pong.py, modifies the MS-DOS COM executable pong.com to reveal a hidden flag in a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. The script applies two byte patches to ensure the program jumps directly to the flag-displaying routine and exits cleanly, displaying the flag when run in DOSBox. This writeup explains the problem, the script's functionality, and its effect.
Problem Context
The pong.com binary is a DOS-based game (likely Pong) containing a hidden flag. The flag is displayed when the game state byte at memory address 0x086B (byte_1086B, file offset 0x086B - 0x0100 = 0x076B) is set to 0x03, triggering a routine at 0x0796 that prints "HERE IS YOUR FLAG :" and renders the flag (as text or pixel graphics). An infinite loop at 0x07DD (file offset 0x07DD - 0x0100 = 0x06DD) with instruction EB FE prevents clean termination. The script patches these locations to show the flag and exit.
Script Analysis
The script automates patching by modifying pong.com at specific offsets and saving the result to a new file. Below is a detailed breakdown.
Script Code
import sys

# Check if input and output file names are provided
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Usage: python patch_pong.py <input_file> <output_file>")
    sys.exit(1)

input_file = sys.argv[1]
output_file = sys.argv[2]

# Define the patches: (offset, bytes)
patches = [
    (0x076B, b'\x03'),      # Set game state to 0x03
    (0x06DD, b'\xCD\x20')   # Replace infinite loop with INT 20h
]

# Calculate the minimum required file size
required_size = max(offset + len(data) for offset, data in patches)

try:
    # Read the original file
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
        data = bytearray(f.read())

    # Check if the file is large enough
    if len(data) < required_size:
        print(f"Error: File is too small. Expected at least {required_size} bytes, got {len(data)}.")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Apply the patches
    for offset, new_bytes in patches:
        data[offset:offset + len(new_bytes)] = new_bytes

    # Write the patched file
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(data)

    print(f"Successfully patched {input_file} to {output_file}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)

Key Components

Command-Line Arguments:

Expects two arguments: input file (pong.com) and output file (e.g., patched_pong.com).
Prints usage instructions and exits if arguments are incorrect.


Patch Definitions:

Two patches:
Offset 0x076B: Set to 0x03 (1 byte). Sets byte_1086B to 0x03, directing the program to the flag-display routine.
Offset 0x06DD: Set to CD 20 (2 bytes). Replaces the infinite loop (EB FE) at 0x07DD with INT 20h, terminating the program.




File Size Check:

Ensures the file is at least 0x076C bytes (highest offset 0x076B + 1).
pong.com is 0x101F bytes (4127), so it passes.


Patching Process:

Reads pong.com into a bytearray.
Overwrites bytes at specified offsets.
Writes the modified bytearray to the output file.


Error Handling:

Catches FileNotFoundError for missing input files.
Handles unexpected errors with descriptive messages.



Why These Patches?

Offset 0x076B: Setting byte_1086B to 0x03 makes the programâ€™s state check (e.g., at 0x010E) jump to loc_10796 (0x0796), which displays the flag.
Offset 0x06DD: Replacing EB FE with CD 20 ensures the program exits after showing the flag, avoiding the infinite loop.

Usage

Save the Script:

Save as patch_pong.py.


Run the Script:

From /mnt/default-linux/Downloads/nexus:python patch_pong.py pong.com patched_pong.com




Run the Patched Binary:

In DOSBox:dosbox
mount c /mnt/default-linux/Downloads/nexus
C:
patched_pong.com


The flag will be printed on the screen.



Technical Details

COM File:
COM files load at 0x0100 in memory. File offsets are memory_address - 0x0100.
File size: 0x101F bytes, sufficient for patches at 0x076B and 0x06DD.


Offsets:
0x076B = 0x086B - 0x0100 (game state).
0x06DD = 0x07DD - 0x0100 (infinite loop).


Patch Effects:
0x076B: Modifies data to trigger flag display.
0x06DD: Changes code to terminate the program.



Verification
Check patches with:
xxd patched_pong.com | grep "0760\|06d0"

Expected:
00006d0: xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx cd 20 xx  ............. ..
0000760: xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx 03 xx xx xx xx  ...............x

Conclusion
The patch_pong.py script efficiently patches pong.com by setting the game state to 0x03 at 0x076B and replacing the infinite loop with INT 20h at 0x06DD. Running patched_pong.com in DOSBox will display the flag directly, solving the CTF challenge.
